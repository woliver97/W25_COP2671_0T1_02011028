Title: Matador

Overview:
Matador is a fast-paced, point-based mini game where players must click (shoot) targets to earn points while avoiding bad targets and collecting power-ups that slow down time. The game ends when the timer reaches zero or when a non-bad target is missed.

How to Play:
- Click on the targets to earn points.
- Some targets are worth more than others.
- Avoid clicking on bad targets (they reduce your score).
- Power-ups occasionally spawn — click them to slow time temporarily.
- The game ends when the timer hits 0 or you miss a non-bad target.

Controls:
- Left Mouse Button: Shoot targets or activate power-ups
- ESC: Open/close pause menu
- ENTER: Begin the game from the title screen and select difficulty

Features:
- Title screen with animated UI and difficulty selection
- Real-time countdown timer and score display
- Power-ups that alter gameplay speed
- Background music with separate sound effects
- Particle effects for target destruction
- Dynamic scoreboard showing the top 5 scores

✔ Two or more distinct sound effects  
✔ Continuous background music  
✔ Game timer with pause support  
✔ Scoreboard and scoring system
